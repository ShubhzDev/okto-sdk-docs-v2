## Creating Embedded Wallets

Okto's embedded wallets provide a seamless way to integrate wallet functionality into your application. This guide explains how to create and manage embedded wallets for your users.

### Automatic Wallet Creation

Okto automatically handles wallet creation for your users. When a user authenticates with your application, Okto creates their embedded wallet addresses across supported chains. This means:

1. No manual wallet creation is required
2. Wallets are instantly available after authentication
3. Users can immediately start interacting with supported chains

### Accessing User Wallets

To retrieve a user's wallets across different chains, use the `getAccount` function:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UnityEngine;

//This is an independent script which called GetWallets() Api
namespace OktoSDK
{
    public class Account : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public async Task<object> GetAccount(OktoClient oc)
        {
            if (oc == null)
            {
                ResponsePanel.SetResponse("You are not logged In!");
                return "You are not logged In!";
            }
            if (!oc.IsLoggedIn())
            {
                ResponsePanel.SetResponse("You are not logged In!");
                return "You are not logged In!";
            }
            try
            {
                return await BffClientRepository.GetBffClientRepository().GetWallets();
            }
            catch (Exception error)
            {
                Debug.LogError($"Failed to retrieve wallets: {error}");
                throw;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<Callout title="Note">
Ensure that the user is authenticated before calling `getAccount()`. You should prompt users to log in if they are not already authenticated.
