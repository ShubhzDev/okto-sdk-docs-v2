Okto lets you securely request "on-behalf-of" permissions from users for their embedded wallets. This is known as delegated actions. It allows your application or backend to perform certain wallet operations without requiring a user signature prompt each time, so long as it adheres to user-approved policies.

## What are delegated actions?

Delegated actions empower your application to take pre-defined actions using a user's embedded wallet, with the user's explicit consent. This means your application can, for example, initiate transactions or sign messages on behalf of the user, within clearly defined boundaries and under secure conditions.

## How to get started with delegated actions

To implement delegated actions in your application:

1. **Capture the Session Key**:
   During user authentication, capture the session private key that's provided in the login callback. This key is essential for performing delegated actions.

   </Callout>

2. **Implementation Example**:
   Here's how to capture the session key during Google OAuth login:

   ```csharp
   public async Task<(string result, Exception error)> LoginGoogle()
   {
       try
       {
           GoogleSignInUser user = await GoogleSignIn.DefaultInstance.SignIn();
           if (user != null)
           {
               Debug.Log($"Signed in successfully! Welcome: {user.DisplayName}");
               Debug.Log($"ID Token: {user.IdToken}");
               // Authenticate with Okto and get session key
               var authResult = await OktoSDK.LoginWithGoogle(user.IdToken);
               if (authResult.Success)
               {
                   // Store session key securely
                   string sessionKey = authResult.SessionKey;
                   return (sessionKey, null);
               }
           }
       }
       catch (Exception ex)
       {
           Debug.LogError($"Login Error: {ex.Message}");
           return (null, ex);
       }
       return (null, null);
   }
   ```

## How It Works
1. **User Consent:** The user must explicitly delegate their embedded wallet to your application.
2. **Limited Scope:** Delegation is governed by a policy engine that enforces limits (e.g., transaction count, spend limits) to protect the user.

## Policy Enforcement
Okto's policy engine may enforce transaction thresholds—such as daily or total spend—beyond which users need to re-confirm.
