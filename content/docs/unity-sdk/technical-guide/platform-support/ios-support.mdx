# iOS Support

The Okto SDK for Unity is designed to work out of the box with iOS builds, requiring no additional dependencies or special configurations in Xcode.

<Callout type="info">
Unity's standard iOS build process is sufficient. No additional steps are required.
</Callout>

## Building for iOS

1. Use Unity's standard build process for iOS
2. Build and run normally in Xcode
3. No additional configurations needed

<Callout type="success">
All necessary functionality is included in the Unity package. You don't need to:
- Add any frameworks
- Modify Info.plist
- Add any dependencies
- Configure any special permissions
</Callout>

## Verification

To verify everything is working correctly:
1. Build your Unity project for iOS
2. Run on an iOS device or simulator
3. Test the authentication flow

If you encounter any issues, they are likely related to your general Unity iOS build settings rather than Okto SDK specific requirements.
