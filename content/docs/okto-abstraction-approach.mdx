import FullscreenImage from 'app/components/mdx/FullscreenImage';

Okto is a comprehensive orchestration layer designed to simplify the complex world of blockchain technology. Our goal is to make Web3 more accessible by addressing common challenges such as:
- **Chain Abstraction** (accessing multiple blockchains seamlessly),
- **Account Management** (secure self-custody without complex private key handling),
- **Transaction Handling** (orchestration and automation of multi-step, cross-chain tasks),
- **Fee Management** (abstracting away different gas tokens and payment flows).

Our goal is to help both developers and end-users navigate Web3 effortlessly, enabling a new era of decentralized applications with **Web2-like** simplicity.

## What is Okto's Abstraction Approach?

Blockchain adoption faces significant challenges due to fragmented ecosystems, complex user experiences, and liquidity issues. **Okto’s Abstraction Approach** addresses these hurdles by hiding the underlying complexities of blockchain technology, enabling seamless, user-friendly experiences across chains, transactions, and wallets.

Okto achieves this by combining cutting-edge solutions like **chain abstraction**, **transaction abstraction**, **wallet abstraction**, and **liquidity abstraction** into a unified architecture. This ensures that developers and end-users can interact with blockchain ecosystems as intuitively as they would with Web2 applications.

## Background & Motivation

While Web3 promises decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment, mainstream adoption has been hindered by challenges like:

- **Complex Wallet Management:** Users often need to juggle multiple wallets, manage private keys, and remember numerous seed phrases.
- **Diverse Gas Fee Requirements:** Navigating varying native tokens for gas across different networks complicates transactions.
- **Fragmented Liquidity and Bridging:** Moving assets between chains involves multiple protocols and bridging steps.
- **Inconsistent Developer Experiences:** Building on diverse blockchain networks often requires dealing with low-level details and bespoke integrations.

Okto was created to bridge these gaps by combining robust crypto primitives with a developer-friendly abstraction layer. Our goal is to make blockchain interactions as simple as “click and done,” allowing dApps to onboard users without friction and empowering developers to build innovative applications without deep blockchain expertise.

## The Six Dimensions of Okto's Abstraction

Through its innovative architecture, Okto simplifies blockchain interactions across six critical dimensions:

### 1. **Chain Abstraction**

Okto’s infrastructure is **chain-agnostic**, supporting both EVM and non-EVM chains like Solana, Aptos, and Cosmos. Developers and users no longer need to manage chain-specific details, enabling:
- Simplified integration for developers building cross-chain applications.
- Seamless multichain interactions for users with a single wallet interface.

---

### 2. **Transaction Abstraction**

Okto eliminates the complexities of blockchain transactions by handling:
- **Payload management:** Automating retries and error handling.
- **Nonce management:** Avoiding transaction failures due to manual nonce mismanagement.
- **Bundled transactions:** Sequencing and parallel execution of multi-step transactions.

This allows developers to focus on building applications while Okto handles the technical heavy lifting behind the scenes.

---

### 3. **Wallet Abstraction**

Okto’s **Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN)** enables:
- **Delegated and gasless transactions:** Users can transact without holding native gas tokens.
- **OAuth and WaaS integration:** Simplifies onboarding through familiar social login options.
- **Secure key management:** Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ensures private keys are never fully exposed, protecting users against single points of failure.

### 4. **Data Abstraction**

Okto monitors all blockchains in real-time to provide live data feeds, including price updates and other critical information, ensuring developers have access to up-to-date data without extra effort.

---

### 5. **Liquidity Abstraction**

Okto’s Universal Liquidity Layer (ULL) facilitates seamless liquidity access across multiple chains, allowing developers to tap into cross-chain liquidity without manual integration, thereby enhancing their app’s capabilities.

---

### 6. **Gas Abstraction**

Through Okto’s cross-ecosystem Gas Station Network (GSN), users can pay transaction fees in their preferred tokens, eliminating the need to hold native tokens for gas fees across different chains.

## The Future of Blockchain: Web2-Like Simplicity

Okto's abstraction approach enables Web3 applications to deliver experiences comparable to Web2 platforms like PayPal or Venmo. By handling blockchain complexities behind the scenes, Okto empowers developers to build **retail-friendly** applications that:
- Simplify onboarding with OAuth and embedded wallets.
- Provide seamless, gas-efficient cross-chain interactions.
- Enable secure, multichain portfolio management.
