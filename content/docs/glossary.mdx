| **Account**        | In Okto, a user's account is a unified representation of all wallets (embedded and external) linked to their identity within your application. It provides a consolidated view of a user's Web3 presence. |
| **App ID**               | A public identifier for your application used to associate your client with Okto.   |
| **API Key**               | A unique identifier for your application within the Okto ecosystem. It is used to authenticate your application and authorize access to Okto services.         |
| **Authorization**         | The process of verifying if a user or application has the right permissions to access specific resources or perform actions. In Okto, this is managed using Okto Auth Tokens.                      |
| **Auth Token**           | A secure token generated by combining user's login credentials, client API Key, and session data. Also known as Okto Auth Token.  |
| **Broadcasting Transactions** | The process of submitting a signed transaction to the blockchain network to be included in a block. |
| **Bulk Order ID**         | An identifier used when multiple orders are processed together for efficiency. A bulk order consists of multiple individual orders grouped for processing.                                        |
| **Chain Abstraction**     | The ability to interact with multiple blockchain networks without dealing with chain-specific details, simplifying development and user experience.                                                  |
| **Client**               | The application or service integrating with Okto's platform (previously referred to as Vendor).                                                                                                       |
| **Connected Wallets**     | Refers to both external wallets that users connect to your application and embedded wallets created within your app. Okto provides a unified way to access and manage these wallets.                |
| **Cross-Chain Operations** | Transactions or operations that involve multiple blockchain networks, facilitated by Okto's interoperability features.                                                                                |
| **Delegated Actions**     | A feature in Okto that allows your application to request user permission to perform specific wallet actions on their behalf, enabling automation and smoother user experiences.               |
| **Embedded Wallets**      | Self-custodial cryptocurrency wallets directly integrated into your application using Okto SDK. They offer a seamless user experience and are managed within your application's interface.         |
| **External Wallets**      | Cryptocurrency wallets managed by third-party providers (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom, WalletConnect). Users connect these existing wallets to your Okto application.                                    |
| **HD Wallets**            | Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets. If supported, Okto allows creation of multiple embedded wallets for a user, derived from a single seed phrase, for enhanced organization and control.         |
| **Job ID**                | A sub-task within an "order" in Okto. Each order, representing a blockchain action, may consist of multiple jobs to complete the overall process.                                                   |
| **JWT (JSON Web Token)**  | A standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. Okto Auth Tokens are JWTs, encoding user and application identity for secure authorization.                                      |
| **MAW (Monthly Active Wallets)** | Total number of unique wallets where a user performs at least one on-chain session in a Web3 application using the Okto SDK within a calendar month (30 days).     |
| **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)** | Cryptographic technique used to secure wallet operations by distributing key management and signing processes across multiple parties, enhancing security and reducing single points of failure. |
| **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** | An enhanced security measure for embedded wallets that requires users to verify their identity using multiple authentication factors before performing sensitive wallet actions.                |
| **Order**                 | In Okto, an "order" represents a request or instruction to perform a specific action on the blockchain, such as token transfer or smart contract interaction. Orders have associated IDs and states. |
| **Order ID**              | A unique identifier for a single "order" in Okto. Each order, representing a blockchain action, is assigned a unique Order ID for tracking and management.                                         |
| **Policy Engine**         | A component of Okto's key management system that enforces predefined rules and permissions for actions within the Okto ecosystem, ensuring security and compliance.                                  |
| **Session Key**           | Key generated by the client for initial authentication processes, used to establish secure communication channels and initiate user sessions.                                                           |
| **Signing Transactions**  | The process of cryptographically signing a transaction with a private key to authorize and authenticate the transaction on the blockchain. |
| **Sponsorship**           | Feature allowing clients to cover transaction fees for users, enhancing user experience by removing gas fee friction and simplifying onboarding to Web3 applications.                                  |
| **Sponsor Wallets**       | Wallets used by Client to cover transaction costs, especially gas fees, on behalf of users. Sponsor wallets enable users to transact without needing to hold native tokens for gas.                     |
| **Tokens**                | In the context of blockchain, tokens represent cryptocurrencies and digital assets that users can manage within their Okto wallets. Okto supports various tokens on different chains.               |
| **Transaction Hash**      | A unique identifier generated by the blockchain when a transaction is executed and confirmed on the network. Transaction hashes are used to track and verify on-chain actions.                       |
| **User**                | Any individual who uses a Client's application and, by extension, utilizes Okto's services to interact with Web3 functionalities.                                                          |
| **Wallet Provider**                | Wallet Provider refers to Okto, Okto platform, and the suite of services Okto provides, including Okto Wallet and SDK.                                                         |
