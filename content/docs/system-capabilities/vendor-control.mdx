Clients in the Okto ecosystem can manage user onboarding, sponsor gas fees for user transactions, and perform their own on-chain operations. Okto provides two specialized wallet constructs to support these client activities: **Treasury Wallet** and **Sponsor Wallet**.

<Callout type="info" title="Info">
- Treasury and Sponsor wallets can be created and managed via the Okto Developer Dashboard.
- For a step-by-step guide, check out the [Treasury Wallet Dashboard Guide](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/treasury-wallet).
</Callout>

## 1. Treasury Wallet

The Treasury Wallet serves as the client's own on-chain identity. It allows clients to:
    * Perform on-chain actions independently of user wallets (e.g., invoking their own smart contracts, executing airdrops, or other DApp-specific operations).
    * Authorize and validate gas sponsorship for user transactions when the sponsorship feature is enabled.

- **Key Features:**
    - **Client-Initiated Transactions:** Execute transactions directly from a wallet controlled by the client.
    - **Aggregated Transaction Execution:** Can be used for operations like batch token transfers or aggregated smart contract interactions.
    - **Sponsorship Authorization:** Acts as the authorizing entity (`feePayerAddress`) for transactions where gas fees are paid by the Sponsor Wallet.

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
A Treasury Wallet is **required** if the client intends to use gas sponsorship or needs to perform any on-chain actions directly from their own account. It is not required if the client's application only facilitates transactions initiated and funded by end-users.
</Callout>

## 2. Sponsor Wallet

The sponsor wallet is primarily designed for **gas sponsorship**. The Sponsor Wallet holds the funds that will be used to pay gas fees for user transactions on supported blockchain networks, enabling a gasless experience for your users.

- **Key Features:**
    - **Gas Fee Sponsorship:** Automatically covers transaction fees for user operations when sponsorship is enabled for the specific chain and a valid Treasury Wallet is set as the fee payer.
    - **Funding Mechanism:** Clients deposit funds directly into the Sponsor Wallet via the Okto Developer Dashboard. These funds are then used exclusively for gas sponsorship.
    - **Chain-Specific Sponsorship:** Clients can enable sponsorship and fund Sponsor Wallets on a per-chain basis.
    - **Policy Integration:** (Future scope) Clients will be able to specify policy constraints (e.g., daily volume limit, per-transaction limit) to manage sponsored funds.
