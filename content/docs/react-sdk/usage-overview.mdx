The Okto React SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools and hooks for integrating blockchain functionality into your React applications. This guide will help you understand the main components and features available in the SDK.

## Core Components

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Hooks">

The SDK provides essential React hooks for accessing Okto functionality:

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `useOkto` | Primary hook that provides access to the OktoClient instance |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account Operations">

Methods available on OktoClient for managing transactions:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `signUserOp` | Sign user operations for transaction security |
| `executeUserOp` | Execute signed user operations on the blockchain |
| `estimate` | Calculate gas estimates for operations |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Explorer Functions">

Functions for retrieving blockchain and account data:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `getAccount` | Retrieve user's wallet information |
| `getChains` | Get supported blockchain networks |
| `getTokens` | Fetch supported tokens list |
| `getPortfolio` | Access user's portfolio data |
| `getPortfolioActivity` | View portfolio transaction history |
| `getPortfolioNFT` | Get user's NFT holdings |
| `getNftCollections` | Retrieve NFT collection details |
| `getOrdersHistory` | Access transaction order history |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent Operations">

Methods for creating different types of blockchain transactions:

| Intent | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `tokenTransfer` | Create operations for transferring tokens |
| `nftTransfer` | Handle NFT transfer operations |
| `evmRawTransaction` | Execute custom EVM transactions |

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Transaction Flow

<Callout type="info">
Most operations in the SDK follow this pattern:

1. Get the OktoClient instance using useOkto hook
2. Create a user operation using intent functions
3. Sign the operation using signUserOp
4. Execute the operation using executeUserOp
</Callout>

For installation, initialization, and example implementations, refer to our [React](/docs/react-sdk/quickstart/new-okto-react-setup) or [Next.js](/docs/react-sdk/quickstart/new-okto-nextjs-setup) setup guides.
