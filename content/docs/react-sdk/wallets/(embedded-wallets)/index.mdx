## Creating Embedded Wallets

Okto's embedded wallets provide a seamless way to integrate wallet functionality into your application. This guide explains how to create and manage embedded wallets for your users.

### Manual Wallet Creation

Okto supports a manual wallet creation approach for embedded wallets, allowing you more control on when embedded wallets are created for your users. For example, the `createWallet()` function allows you to create an embedded wallet for the currently authenticated user.

**Implementation**

```ts
import { useOkto, type OktoContextType } from 'okto-sdk-react';

const { createWallet } = useOkto() as OktoContextType;

// Create a wallet for the authenticated user
createWallet()
    .then((result) => {
        console.log('Wallet created:', result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error creating wallet:', error);
    });
```

<Callout title="Note">
Ensure that the user is authenticated before calling createWallet(). You should prompt users to log in if they are not already authenticated.
