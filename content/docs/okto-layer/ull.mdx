import FullscreenImage from 'app/components/mdx/FullscreenImage';

The **Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL)** is a crucial component of the Okto Platform, designed to address liquidity fragmentation across the Web3 landscape. ULL acts as an "aggregator of aggregators," routing cross-chain swaps and transfers through the most efficient and cost-effective pathways available, simplifying cross-chain asset management for users and applications.

## Core Functionality

The ULL's primary function is to provide a unified and optimized access point to cross-chain liquidity. It abstracts away the complexities of navigating multiple bridges, DEXs, and liquidity sources, offering a seamless and efficient experience for cross-chain asset movements.

Key functionalities include:

- **Aggregator of Aggregators:**  Utilizes liquidity from various sources, including:
    - ERC-7683 compatible solvers.
    - Third-party bridging and swapping protocols (e.g., LayerZero, Wormhole, Socket, Across).
    - Canonical bridges.

- **Optimal Pathfinding and Routing:**  Intelligently analyzes and selects the most efficient routes for cross-chain swaps and transfers, minimizing fees and execution time.

- **ERC-7683 Standard Implementation:** By leveraging this Ethereum standard, ULL ensures a unified approach to cross-chain liquidity, enabling seamless interaction across diverse ecosystems, including non-EVM chains like Solana and Aptos.

- **Minimized Fees:** While users pay network fees and a small Okto fee, the ULL's efficient routing and operation pooling often results in lower total costs compared to manual bridging.

- **Multi-Chain Gasless Operations:** Supports gasless transactions by abstracting the complexities of fee management across different chains.


## Architecture

- **Trade Service:**  A backend engine that acts as the decision maker, interfacing with various bridging and DEX protocols to gather quotes and route information.

- **Integration with External Protocols:**  Connects to various bridging protocols (e.g., LayerZero, Wormhole, Socket) and DEX aggregators to access diverse liquidity pools.

- **ERC-7683 Settlement Contracts:**  Deployed on each chain, lock user funds and release them once bridging or swap conditions are met.

- **Solver and Settler Nodes:** Off-chain entities that participate in the ULL framework as liquidity providers and verification/settlement agents.
    - Solvers: Entities that can front-run bridging or swapping.
    - Settlers: Confirm destination chain events back to the source chain contract to finalize the operation.
