## What is Okto?

Okto is a comprehensive end-to-end chain abstraction platform designed to simplify the complex world of blockchain technology. Our mission is "Bringing the world on chain" by making Web3 more accessible to everyone – not just developers and crypto enthusiasts, but anyone who wants to participate in the digital future.

Okto addresses common challenges such as:
- **Chain Abstraction** (accessing multiple blockchains seamlessly),
- **Account Management** (secure self-custody without complex private key handling),
- **Transaction Handling** (orchestration and automation of multi-step, cross-chain tasks),
- **Fee Management** (abstracting away different gas tokens and payment flows).

Just as web browsers made the internet accessible without understanding complex HTTP protocols, Okto aims to enable users to interact with blockchain through intuitive interfaces where the underlying complexity happens invisibly.

## Background & Motivation

While Web3 promises decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment, mainstream adoption has been hindered by challenges like:

- **Complex Wallet Management:** Users often need to juggle multiple wallets, manage private keys, and remember numerous seed phrases.
- **Diverse Gas Fee Requirements:** Navigating varying native tokens for gas across different networks complicates transactions.
- **Fragmented Liquidity and Bridging:** Moving assets between chains involves multiple protocols and bridging steps.
- **Inconsistent Developer Experiences:** Building on diverse blockchain networks often requires dealing with low-level details and bespoke integrations.

Okto was created to bridge these gaps by combining robust crypto primitives with a developer-friendly abstraction layer. Our goal is to make blockchain interactions as simple as “click and done,” allowing dApps to onboard users without friction and empowering developers to build innovative applications without deep blockchain expertise.

## Okto's Suite of Products

### 1. Okto Wallet

**Okto Wallet** is the flagship fully featured DeFi application built on Okto. Available on the Play Store and App Store, it highlights the power of end-to-end chain abstraction with features that would be nearly impossible to implement without Okto's infrastructure:

- **1-Click Cross-Chain Swaps**: Seamlessly trade assets across EVM chains, Solana, Aptos, and more.
- **Gasless Transactions**: No need to hold native tokens for gas fees on any chain. Pay gas fees with any stable token you own.
- **DEX Futures with 50X leverage**: Trade derivatives across 100+ token pairs powered by Hyperliquid.
- **Unified Trading Interface**: Trade across spot markets and derivatives from a single dashboard.
- **Airdrop Opportunities**: Stay updated on potential airdrops.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Manage assets across 30+ chains, including EVM, Solana, Aptos, and Cosmos.

### 2. Okto SDK

<Callout title="Note">
Okto Wallet and Okto SDK are independent offerings:

- **Okto Wallet**: A standalone DeFi app on iOS/Android that helps users take advantage of Defi and trading opportunities in a Web2 like interface.
- **Okto SDK**: A developer tool to help build for Web3 while abstracting out the complexities.
</Callout>

The Okto SDK allows developers to leverage Okto's chain abstraction technology in their own applications. Available for React, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and TypeScript, it offers:

- **Interoperable Embedded Wallets**: Onboard users to Web3 with a familiar Web2-like experience.
- **Easy Integration**: Embed Okto SDK in any Web2 applications and convert it to Web3 in just a few steps.
- **Simplified Development**: Abstract away the complexities of Web3, allowing even Web2 developers to build blockchain-enabled apps.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Available for various frontend frameworks and blockchain ecosystems.
- **Multi-chain Development Simplified**: Implement features across multiple blockchains with a single interface—eliminating the need to learn chain-specific code for each ecosystem.
- **Intent-based Transactions**: Implement complex multi-step operations with simple function calls

Dozens of innovative projects across gaming, DeFi, and social applications are already leveraging the Okto SDK, creating applications that combine Web2-like simplicity with Web3 power. [Learn more](/docs/okto-sdk)

### 3. Trade Service (Coming Soon)

Built on Okto's Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL), the Trade Service enables seamless cross-chain token swaps through a powerful API suite:

**Key Features:**

* **Any-to-Any Swaps**: Swap any token for any other token across multiple chains
* **Optimal Routing**: Finds the best swap route for price and execution efficiency
* **Bridgeless Design**: No direct bridge interaction required from users
* **Fast Settlements**: Rapid cross-chain liquidity provisioning
* **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-implement APIs for developers

The Trade Service makes possible seamless cross-chain swaps, optimized routing, and batch settlements for improved efficiency and lower overall costs. For users, this means saying goodbye to manual bridging, liquidity hunting across DEXs, and maintaining separate balances for gas on different chains.
