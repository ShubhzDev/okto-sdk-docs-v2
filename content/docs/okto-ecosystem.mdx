## What is Okto?

Okto is a comprehensive end-to-end chain abstraction platform designed to simplify the complex world of blockchain technology. Our mission is "Bringing the world on chain" by making Web3 more accessible to everyone – not just developers and crypto enthusiasts, but anyone who wants to participate in the digital future.

Okto addresses common challenges such as:
- **Chain Abstraction** (accessing multiple blockchains seamlessly),
- **Account Management** (secure self-custody without complex private key handling),
- **Transaction Handling** (orchestration and automation of multi-step, cross-chain tasks),
- **Fee Management** (abstracting away different gas tokens and payment flows).

Just as web browsers made the internet accessible without understanding complex HTTP protocols, Okto aims to enable users to interact with blockchain through intuitive interfaces where the underlying complexity happens invisibly.

## Background & Motivation

While Web3 promises decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment, mainstream adoption has been hindered by challenges like:

- **Complex Wallet Management:** Users often need to juggle multiple wallets, manage private keys, and remember numerous seed phrases.
- **Diverse Gas Fee Requirements:** Navigating varying native tokens for gas across different networks complicates transactions.
- **Fragmented Liquidity and Bridging:** Moving assets between chains involves multiple protocols and bridging steps.
- **Inconsistent Developer Experiences:** Building on diverse blockchain networks often requires dealing with low-level details and bespoke integrations.

Okto was created to bridge these gaps by combining robust crypto primitives with a developer-friendly abstraction layer. Our goal is to make blockchain interactions as simple as “click and done,” allowing dApps to onboard users without friction and empowering developers to build innovative applications without deep blockchain expertise.
