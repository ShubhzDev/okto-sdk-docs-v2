import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

This document outlines all supported swap flows within the **Okto Trade Service**, including both same-chain and cross-chain scenarios. Each swap operation is executed via a sequence of on-chain transactions, some of which may involve routing, bridging, or intermediate conversions. These steps are abstracted from the end-user to ensure seamless and secure execution.

## Swap

<Callout title="Understand FST and Non-FST Tokens" type="info">
- **FST (Filler Supported Tokens):** Tokens natively supported by the ULL (Unified Liquidity Layer) and eligible for direct bridging across chains.
- **Non-FST (Filler Unsupported Tokens):** Tokens not supported by ULL for bridging. These must be first converted to an FST before bridging.

For more details, check the Supported Networks & Tokens guide.

## 1. Same Chain Swap (Non-FST -> FST/Non-FST)

This is an intra-chain swap, where both the source and destination tokens exist on the same blockchain. The transaction is performed within the user's wallet address and does **not** involve any cross-chain messaging or bridging.

**Example-** Swap WETH (Non-FST) to USDT (FST) on the Base network.

### Execution Flow

(Image 1. Same Chain Swap (Non-FST -> FST/Non-FST))

- **Transaction Initiation-** User initiates a swap between two tokens on the same chain.
- **On-Chain Swap-** The Trade Service leverages on-chain aggregators to perform the token swap directly in the user's wallet.

## 2. Pure Cross Chain Bridge (FST -> FST)

In this scenario, a supported FST token is bridged from the source chain to the destination chain. Both source and destination tokens must be FSTs.

**Example-** Swap USDC (FST) on BSC to USDC (FST) on Ethereum.

### Execution Flow

(Image 2. Pure Cross Chain Bridge (FST -> FST))

- **Transaction Initiation-** The user begins a swap involving a FST.
- **Bridging Transaction-** The source token is locked on the source chain via ULL.
- **Token Release on Destination Chain-** The equivalent FST is released on the destination chain.

## 3. Bridge + Destination Swap (FST -> Non-FST)

This scenario begins with a FST on the source chain, allowing direct bridging via ULL. After the token is transferred to the destination chain, it is then swapped into a Non-FST using a same-chain swap.

**Example-** Swap USDC on BSC (FST) to ETH on Ethereum (Non-FST).

### Execution Flow

(Image 3. Bridge + Destination Swap (FST -> Non-FST))

- **Transaction Initiation-** The user begins a swap involving a FST on source chain.
- **Bridging Transaction-** The source FST is locked on the source chain via ULL.
- **Token Release on Destination Chain-** The equivalent FST is released on the destination chain.
- **Destination-Side Swap-** The received FST is swapped into the requested Non-FST via on-chain aggregators.

## 4. Source Swap + Bridge (Non-FST -> FST)

In this scenario, the user starts with a Non-FST on the source chain. Because Non-FST tokens cannot be directly bridged, the system first converts it to a FST using a same-chain swap. The resulting FST is then bridged to the destination chain.

**Example:** Swap ETH (Non-FST) on Ethereum to USDC (FST) on Base.

### Execution Flow

(Image 4. Source Swap + Bridge (Non-FST -> FST))

- **Transaction Initiation-** User initiates a cross-chain swap using a Non-FST token.
- **Source-Side Swap-** Non-FST is converted to a supported FST token using on-chain aggregators..
- **Bridging via ULL-** The FST is then bridged from the source chain to the destination chain.

## 5. Source Swap + Bridge + Destination Swap (Non-FST -> Non-FST)

This is the most comprehensive swap flow, involving a Non-FST on both the source and destination chains. The source Non-FST is first converted to an FST, then bridged, and finally swapped again to the target Non-FST.

**Example:** Swap ETH (Non-FST) on Ethereum to SHIBA (FST) on BSC.

### Execution Flow

(Image 5. Source Swap + Bridge + Destination Swap (Non-FST -> Non-FST))

- **Transaction Initiation-** A cross-chain swap is initiated using a token that is not filler-supported.
- **Source-Side Swap-** The Non-FST is first swapped on the source chain into a FST that ULL can bridge.
- **Bridging via ULL-** The FST is then bridged from the source chain to the destination chain.
- **Destination-Side Swap-** The bridged FST is further swapped on the destination chain to obtain the final desired token.
