## Introduction

Executing a seamless any-to-any cross-chain swap via the Okto Trade Service involves a sophisticated orchestration between various actors and system components. Each plays a distinct role in translating a user's simple request into a successfully settled transaction across different blockchain networks. Understanding these actors helps clarify how Okto achieves this complexity abstraction.

    "Specifies what they want to swap (e.g., 'Swap X amount of Token A on Chain 1 for Token B on Chain 2')",
    "Reviews the quote and details provided by the application",
    "Approves and signs the final transaction proposed by the application"

    "Considers price, gas, speed, and slippage for optimal routing",
    "Interacts with external DEX Aggregators if necessary for on-chain swaps",
    "Structures the cross-chain transfer request into a formal 'intent'",

    "The Okto Trade Service may route parts of the transaction through these aggregators if the user's source token needs to be swapped into a ULL-compatible asset/FST before the cross-chain transfer",

## Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL) Actors

The ULL is the core Okto infrastructure responsible for the secure and efficient cross-chain settlement part of the swap. It involves its own set of specialized actors:

<PersonaDescriptionCard 
  title="Facilitator Node"
  iconPath="/images/facilitator-node-icon.svg"
  description="The primary off-chain coordinator within the ULL network that manages the intent's lifecycle. Currently, Okto runs the facilitator nodes."
  whatItDoes={[
    "Receives structured intents from the Trade Service",
    "Broadcasts these intents to the network of Fillers",
    "Matches the intent with an available Filler based on efficiency and cost",
    "Manages the intent's lifecycle within the ULL system"
  ]}
  whatItIs={null}
  howToIdentify={null}
/>
<br/>
<PersonaDescriptionCard 
  title="Fillers (or Solvers)"
  iconPath="/images/filler-icon.svg"
  description="Independent liquidity providers who actively monitor the network for intents and bridge the liquidity gap between chains. Currently Okto has a network of fillers, later this will be opened to any external participants."
  whatItDoes={[
    "Monitor the network for intents broadcast by the Facilitator Node",
    "Provide the required funds (the desired token) to the User's address on the destination chain",
    "Undertake the cross-chain execution risk, typically earning a fee or capturing a price spread for their service."

  howToIdentify={null}

<br/>
<PersonaDescriptionCard 
  title="Settlers"
  iconPath="/images/settler-icon.svg"
  description="Entities interacting with the ULL smart contracts on the source chain to finalize the transaction after a Filler confirms successful execution on the destination chain."
  whatItDoes={[
    "Interact with the ULL smart contracts on the source chain",
    "Verify the Filler's success proof of destination chain execution",
    "Release the User's original deposited funds to the Filler",
    "Complete the economic cycle of the swap",
    "Compensate the Filler for providing destination chain liquidity"
