Okto Trade Service offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities to make token swaps a seamless and abstracted experience for both the users and developers. It handles estimations, routing algorithms, filler-facilitator-settler matching, slippage calculation, and more. The service is built for use within the Okto platform and is also suitable for integration into other Web3 dApps.

The Okto Trade Service functions as:
- Independent Liquidity Filler- Okto operates as its own aggregator, with the ability to independently fulfill swap intents using internal liquidity sources and routing logic.

- Aggregator of Aggregators- In addition to its internal liquidity, Okto integrates with multiple third-party aggregators and liquidity providers. This enables the platform to source the most optimal routes and pricing from a wide range of external providers.

## Swap

### Same Chain Swap 

A same chain swap involves converting one token to another on the same blockchain, within the same user's wallet address. It does not require any cross-chain communication or bridging. 

**Example-** Swap ETH to USDT on the Base network.

### Cross Chain Swap

A cross chain swap enables token conversion across different blockchains, delivering the final tokens to the same user’s wallet on the destination chain. This process typically involves bridging assets between chains.

**Example-** Swap SHIBA on BSC to USDT on Ethereum.
