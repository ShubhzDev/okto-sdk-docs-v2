The Okto Trade Service is a powerful API suite that enables developers to integrate seamless cross-chain token swaps into their applications. Built on Okto's Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL), the Trade Service eliminates the complexity traditionally associated with cross-chain transactions, abstracting away the need for multiple bridge interactions and providing a single, unified interface for any-to-any token swaps.

The Okto Trade Service functions as:
- **Independent Liquidity Filler:** Okto operates as its own aggregator, with the ability to independently fulfill swap intents using internal liquidity sources and routing logic.

- **Aggregator of Aggregators:** In addition to its internal liquidity, Okto integrates with multiple third-party aggregators and liquidity providers. This enables the platform to source the most optimal routes and pricing from a wide range of external providers.

## Features

Trade Service offers following fetures: 
- **Any-to-Any Swaps:** Swap any token for any other token across multiple chains
- **Optimal Routing:** Finds the best swap route for price and execution efficiency
- **Bridgeless Design:** No direct bridge interaction required from users
- **Fast Settlements:** Rapid cross-chain liquidity provisioning
- **Simple Integration:** Easy-to-implement APIs

## Core Concepts

### Intent-Based Swaps

The Trade Service uses an intent-based model where users express what they want to accomplish ("Swap Token A on Chain 1 for Token B on Chain 2") rather than how to do it. This allows the system to determine the most efficient execution path.

### Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL)

The ULL is the infrastructure that makes cross-chain swaps possible by orchestrating liquidity across multiple blockchain ecosystems. It provides:

- A network of liquidity providers (called "solvers" or "fillers")
- Smart contract infrastructure for secure cross-chain settlement
- A coordination layer that matches intents with solvers

### Swap

#### Same Chain Swap 

A same chain swap involves converting one token to another on the same blockchain, within the same user's wallet address. It does not require any cross-chain communication or bridging. 

**Example-** Swap ETH to USDT on the Base network.

#### Cross Chain Swap

A cross chain swap enables token conversion across different blockchains, delivering the final tokens to the same user’s wallet on the destination chain. This process typically involves bridging assets between chains.

**Example-** Swap SHIBA on BSC to USDT on Ethereum.
