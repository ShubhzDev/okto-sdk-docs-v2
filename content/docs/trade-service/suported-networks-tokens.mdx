## Overview

Trade Service supports a wide range of swap and bridge flows across EVM and SVM networks. These transaction types enable asset interoperability through native swaps, cross-chain bridging, and token conversions on either or both ends of the transaction path.

All supported flows ensure optimal pathing through liquidity aggregators such as 1inch, Socket, Lifi, Jupiter, Unizen and Okto ULL.
