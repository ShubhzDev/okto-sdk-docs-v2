## **What is Sponsorship?**

Sponsorship is a feature that allows you to cover transaction fees (gas fees) for your users. This creates a smoother user experience by removing the need for users to hold native tokens for transaction fees.

## **How Sponsorship Works with Okto Across Ecosystems**

Sponsorship integrates with Okto's wallet infrastructure to automatically cover gas fees for transactions on supported chains for all transactions initiated by the client across users. When a user initiates a transaction, the sponsorship system pays the required gas fee, allowing the transaction to proceed even if the user doesn't have the native token for gas.

## **Prerequisites**

* Enable chains in your Okto dashboard  
* Activate sponsorship individually for each of the enabled chains that needs sponsorship 
* Load native tokens into your sponsorship account


## **Loading Funds to Sponsorship**

1. Only native tokens of the respective chains can be loaded into sponsorship accounts.  
2. Each chain has a unique sponsorship address. You can find this address in your Okto dashboard.  
3. For testnets, you can use faucets to acquire tokens. 

## **Sponsorship Necessity**

You can disable sponsorship on the admin panel if activated. If not activated, you don't need to activate it until you need to use it.

## **Sponsorship Usage Across Chains**

* All chains: Gas fees  
* Aptos and Solana: Account creation and initiation  
* Solana specific: SPL ATA accounts, nonce advancement, rent

## **Sponsorship Authority and Security**

You have full authority over your sponsorship account. Neither Okto nor any third party can drain your sponsorship funds.

## **Recommended Minimum Amounts**

Recommended minimum amounts vary by chain.
