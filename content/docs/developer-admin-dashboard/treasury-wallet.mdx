## Overview

A Treasury Wallet in Okto is a client-controlled Smart Wallet Account (SWA). Unlike end-user SWAs, Treasury Wallets serve as your (the client's) on-chain identity, allowing you to perform blockchain operations directly and to authorize gas sponsorship for your users' transactions.

Treasury Wallets, Sponsor Wallets, and User Wallets are all [DWN](/docs/okto-layer/dwn) based smart contract wallets, sharing similar underlying technology but differing in their intended use and management.

**Key Use Cases for Treasury Wallets:**

- **Client-Side Chain Interactions:** Execute transactions or interact with smart contracts directly from a wallet you control. This is useful for operations like airdrops, DApp-specific administrative functions, or any scenario where your application logic needs to initiate an on-chain action.
- **Enabling Gas Sponsorship:** A Treasury Wallet is **mandatory** if you wish to sponsor gas fees for your users. It acts as the authorizing entity (`feePayerAddress`) for such transactions.

## Creating a Treasury Wallet

2.  Click the **Create Wallet** button.

3.  A new Treasury Wallet will be created. Its **Treasury SWA** (the unique address of this Treasury Wallet) will be displayed. You can create multiple Treasury Wallets if needed (e.g., for scaling or organizational purposes).

## Funding Treasury Wallets

If you plan to use a Treasury Wallet to authorize gas sponsorship, it must hold a small amount of native tokens on the destination chain where the sponsored transactions will occur. This serves as a verification step to ensure the Treasury Wallet is active on that chain.

The process to fund your Treasury Wallet is now streamlined directly through the Okto Dashboard:

1. Navigate to the **Treasury Wallet** section in your dashboard and select the wallet you wish to fund.

2. Click the **Deposit** button in the top-right corner of the wallet details panel.

3. Select the blockchain network (destination chain) you want to fund from the available options (Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, etc.).

4. Once you've selected a chain, you'll be presented with a QR code and wallet address specific to that chain.

5. Transfer a small amount of the native token from that chain (e.g., ETH for Base, MATIC for Polygon) to the provided address.

> **Important**: Always ensure you're sending tokens via the correct chain only, to avoid losing your funds. The wallet address shown is specific to the selected blockchain network.

These funds serve as a verification step and are not consumed for the actual gas fees of sponsored transactions (those come from the Sponsor Wallet).
