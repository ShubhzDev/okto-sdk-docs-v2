## Error Response

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive the following error response:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "error": {
        "code": 429,
        "errorCode": "ER-TECH-0100",
        "message": "Rate Limit Exceeded",
        "trace_id": "678a3f1e00000000ced7e3483989507c"
    }
}
```

Following industry standards, a **`retry-after` response header** will be included when a rate-exceeded error is encountered. The value of this header indicates the **time (in seconds)** after which the rate limit restriction will expire. You can retry your request after this period.
